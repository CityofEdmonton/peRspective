Perspective is an API that uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation. [Website](http://www.perspectiveapi.com/).

`peRspective` provides access to the API using the R programming language.

For an excellent documentation of the Perspective API see [here](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/blob/master/api_reference.md).

> This is a work-in-progress project and I welcome feedback and pull requests!

## Setup

### Get an API key

1. Create a Google Cloud project in your [Google Cloud console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Go to [Perspective API's overview page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/overview) and click **Enable**
3. Go to the [API credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), just click **Create credentials**, and choose "API Key".

Now you are ready to make a request to the Perspective API!

### Quota and character length Limits

Be sure to check your quota limit! You can learn more about Perspective API quota limit by visiting [your google cloud project's Perspective API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/quotas).

The maximum text size per request is 3000 bytes.

## Models

For detailed overview of the used models [see here](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/blob/master/api_reference.md).

Here is a list of models currently supported by `peRspective`:

```{r, echo=F}
library(tidyverse)

tibble::tribble(
  ~`Model Attribute Name`,  ~Version,                                  ~`Supported Languages`,   ~`Short Description`,
             "TOXICITY",     "Alpha",                                  "en, es, fr\\*, de\\*",    "rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a discussion.",  
      "SEVERE_TOXICITY",     "Alpha",                                  "en, es, fr\\*, de\\*",    "Same deep-CNN algorithm as TOXICITY, but is trained on 'very toxic' labels.",
      "IDENTITY_ATTACK",     "Experimental toxicity sub-attribute",    "en, fr\\*, de\\*, es\\*", "negative or hateful comments targeting someone because of their identity.",
               "INSULT",     "Experimental toxicity sub-attribute",    "en, fr\\*, de\\*, es\\*", "insulting, inflammatory, or negative comment towards a person or a group of people.",
            "PROFANITY",     "Experimental toxicity sub-attribute",    "en, fr\\*, de\\*, es\\*", "swear words, curse words, or other obscene or profane language.",

               "THREAT",     "Experimental toxicity sub-attribute",    "en, fr\\*, de\\*, es\\*", "describes an intention to inflict pain, injury, or violence against an individual or group.",
           "FLIRTATION",     "Experimental toxicity sub-attribute",    "en, fr\\*, de\\*, es\\*", "pickup lines, complimenting appearance, subtle sexual innuendos, etc.",
     "ATTACK_ON_AUTHOR",     "NYT moderation models",                  "en",                      "Attack on the author of an article or post.",
  "ATTACK_ON_COMMENTER",    "NYT moderation models",                   "en",                      "Attack on fellow commenter.",
           "INCOHERENT",     "NYT moderation models",                  "en",                      "Difficult to understand, nonsensical.",
         "INFLAMMATORY",     "NYT moderation models",                  "en",                      "Intending to provoke or inflame.",
     "LIKELY_TO_REJECT",     "NYT moderation models",                  "en",                      "Overall measure of the likelihood for the comment to be rejected according to the NYT's moderation.",

        "UNSUBSTANTIAL",     "NYT moderation models",                  "en",                       "Trivial or short comments."
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

**Note:** Languages that are annotated with "*" are only accessible in the `_EXPERIMENTAL` version of the models. In order to access them just add to the supplied model string like this: `TOXICITY_EXPERIMENTAL`.

A character vector that includes all supported models can be obtained like this:

```{r}
c(
  peRspective::prsp_models,
  peRspective::prsp_exp_models
)
```

## Usage

First, install package from GitHub:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("favstats/peRspective")
```

Load package:

```{r}
library(peRspective)
```

Also the `tidyverse` for examples.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


Define your key variable.

```{r, echo = F}
key <- readr::read_lines("prsp.txt")

Sys.setenv(perspective_api_key = key)

```

`peRspective` functions will read the API key from environment variable `perspective_api_key`. You can assign an environment object like this in your script:


```{r, eval = F}
Sys.setenv(perspective_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

### `prsp_score`

Now you can use `prsp_score` to score your comments with various models provided by the Perspective API.

```{r, eval = T}

my_text <- "You wrote this? Wow. This is dumb and childish, please go f**** yourself."

text_scores <- prsp_score(
           text = my_text, 
           languages = "en",
           score_model = peRspective::prsp_models
           )

text_scores %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  mutate(key = fct_reorder(key, value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(key, value)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Model", y = "Probability", title = "Perspective API Results")
```

A Trump Tweet:

```{r}
trump_tweet <- "The Fake News Media has NEVER been more Dishonest or Corrupt than it is right now. There has never been a time like this in American History. Very exciting but also, very sad! Fake News is the absolute Enemy of the People and our Country itself!"

text_scores <- prsp_score(
           trump_tweet, 
           score_sentences = F,
           score_model = peRspective::prsp_models
           )

text_scores %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  mutate(key = fct_reorder(key, value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(key, value)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Model", y = "Probability", title = "Perspective API Results")
```


Instead of scoring just entire comments you can also score individual sentences with `score_sentences = T`. In this case the Perspective API will automatically split your text into reasonable sentences and score them in addition to an overall score.

```{r, eval = T, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
trump_tweet <- "The Fake News Media has NEVER been more Dishonest or Corrupt than it is right now. There has never been a time like this in American History. Very exciting but also, very sad! Fake News is the absolute Enemy of the People and our Country itself!"

text_scores <- prsp_score(
           trump_tweet, 
           score_sentences = T,
           score_model = peRspective::prsp_models
           )

text_scores %>% 
  unnest(sentence_scores) %>% 
  select(type, score, sentences) %>% 
  gather(value, key, -sentences, -score) %>% 
  mutate(key = fct_reorder(key, score)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(key, score)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~sentences, ncol = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Model", y = "Probability", title = "Perspective API Results")


```

You can also use Spanish (`es`) for `TOXICITY` and `SEVERE_TOXICITY` and `_EXPERIMENTAL`scoring.

```{r}
spanish_text <- "gastan en cosas que de nada sirven-nunca tratan de saber la verdad del funcionalismo de nuestro sistema solar y origen del cosmos-falso por Kepler. LAS UNIVERSIDADES DEL MUNDO NO SABEN ANALIZAR VERDAD O MENTIRA-LO QUE DICE KEPLER"


text_scores <- prsp_score(
           text = spanish_text, 
           languages = "es",
           key = key,
           score_model = c("TOXICITY", "SEVERE_TOXICITY", "INSULT_EXPERIMENTAL")
           )

text_scores %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  mutate(key = fct_reorder(key, value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(key, value)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed")  +
  labs(x = "Model", y = "Probability", title = "Perspective API Results")
```

### `prsp_stream`

So far we have only seen how to get individual comments or sentences scored. But what if you would like to run the function for an entire dataset with a text column? This is where `prsp_stream` comes in. At its core `prsp_stream` is a loop implemented within `purrr::map` to iterate over your text column. To use it let's first generate a mock tibble.

```{r}
text_sample <- tibble(
       ctext = c("You wrote this? Wow. This is dumb and childish, please go f**** yourself.",
                 "I don't know what to say about this but it's not good. The commenter is just an idiot",
                 "This goes even further!",
                 "What the hell is going on?",
                 "Please. I don't get it. Explain it again",
                 "Annoying and irrelevant! I'd rather watch the paint drying on the wall!"),
       textid = c("#efdcxct", "#ehfcsct", 
                  "#ekacxwt",  "#ewatxad", 
                  "#ekacswt",  "#ewftxwd")
       )
```

`prsp_stream` requires a `text` and `text_id column`. It wraps `prsp_score` and takes all its arguments. Let's run the most basic version:

```{r, message=T}
text_sample %>%
  prsp_stream(text = ctext,
              text_id = textid,
              score_model = c("TOXICITY", "SEVERE_TOXICITY"))
```

You receive a `tibble` with your desired scorings including the `text_id` to match your score with your original dataframe.

Now, the problem is that sometimes the call might fail at some point. It is therefore suggested to set `safe_output = TRUE`. This will put the function into a `purrr::safely` environment to ensure that your function will keep running even if you encounter errors. 

Let's try it out with a new dataset that contains text that the Perspective API can't score

```{r}
text_sample <- tibble(
       ctext = c("You wrote this? Wow. This is dumb and childish, please go f**** yourself.",
                 "I don't know what to say about this but it's not good. The commenter is just an idiot",
                 ## empty string
                 "",
                 "This goes even further!",
                 "What the hell is going on?",
                 "Please. I don't get it. Explain it again",
                 ## Gibberish
                 "kdlfkmgkdfmgkfmg",
                 "Annoying and irrelevant! I'd rather watch the paint drying on the wall!",
                 ## Gibberish
                 "Hippi Hoppo"),
       textid = c("#efdcxct", "#ehfcsct", 
                  "#ekacxwt",  "#ewatxad", 
                  "#ekacswt",  "#ewftxwd", 
                  "#eeadswt",  "#enfhxed",
                  "#efdmjd")
       )
```

And run the function with `safe_output = TRUE`.

```{r, message=T}
text_sample %>%
  prsp_stream(text = ctext,
              text_id = textid,
              score_model = c("TOXICITY", "SEVERE_TOXICITY", "INSULT"),
              safe_output = T)
```

`safe_output = T` will also provide us with the error messages that occured so that we can check what went wrong!

Finally, there is one last argument: `verbose = TRUE`. Enable this argument and thanks to [`crayon`](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon) you will receive beautiful console output that guides you along the way, showing you errors and text scores as you go.


```{r, eval = F}
text_sample %>%
  prsp_stream(text = ctext,
              text_id = textid,
              score_model = c("TOXICITY", "SEVERE_TOXICITY"),
              verbose = T,
              safe_output = T)
```

Or the (not as pretty) output in Markdown

```{r, echo = F}
text_sample %>%
  prsp_stream(text = ctext,
              text_id = textid,
              score_model = c("TOXICITY", "SEVERE_TOXICITY"),
              verbose = T,
              safe_output = T)


```
